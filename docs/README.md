I am Björn Strausmann, hailing from the vicinity of Hamburg in Germany. 

My journey with Chocolatey spans over 6 years, during which I've encountered situations where the extensive array of packages within the Chocolatey community did not cover my specific software needs. As time went on, this aspect grew increasingly apparent.

Over time, I created my own Chocolatey Packages and made them available to the community.
I think it is an important part of the community not only to take, but also to give something back.

With the addition of each new package, the collective effort required to maintain these packages in an up-to-date state escalated. Having experienced it firsthand, I understand the frustration of encountering outdated software packages within the Chocolatey community.

This realization has led me to immerse myself in the realm of automating Chocolatey packages through Continuous Integration. As a result of these endeavors, I present to you an overview of my software packages in the form of a documentation page.

Should you encounter any challenges or inquiries, I encourage you to raise an issue within the GitHub project.

I explicitly point out that this is a private, non-commercial project.

Warm regards,

Björn
